## Task 
Task is to implement Dijkstra's algorithm and build a tree of the shortest paths from a given vertex for an oriented, weighted graph. The solution will be the average path length from a given vertex to all other vertices that can be reached with s.

## Incoming data
The first line contains the numbers N - the number of edges and s - the initial vertex. The next N lines are pairs of vertices connected by an edge and the weight of that edge.
 
## Output data
Average path length
